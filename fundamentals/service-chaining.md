## Use Case
Organisations have access to a variety of digital assets<sup>1</sup> that provide the basic building block functionalities of their businesses. However, it is often required to connect a chosen set of functions of such assets in a specific, sequential order to achieve complex service delivery requirements. This is mainly because of the demand for agility that comes from the business side.

<sup>1</sup>_Internal software systems, SoR,  Partner systems, Device APIs etc_

## Solution
The proposed solution is generally referred to as Service Chaining. In simple terms, Service chaining is the idea of connecting multiple network service endpoints in a **specific sequence** to form a logical chain of services that produces a single outcome by consuming responses of different services.

The most common way of implementing this is through a proxy service built as a micro-service, serverless function or a piece of middleware. The **processing** steps depicted in the above diagram may include any relevant action such as data caching, transformation, enrichment and aggregation.

Service Chaining can be treated as a subset of Service Orchestration. It represents the idea of sequential communication with service endpoints, whereas the generic term Service Orchestration includes all other styles such as parallel-invocation and recepients-list style communication.
